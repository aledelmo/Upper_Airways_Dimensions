# Upper Airways Development

![uad](https://i.imgur.com/76VHM5A.png)

Development of airway structures from birth to adolescence using high-resolution CT scans. Correlation between airway measurements and biometric data.

This comprehensive anatomical database of upper airway dimensions provides important data in the field of pediatric airway anatomy, particularly relating to the cricoid. We demonstrated that laryngeal, tracheal, and bronchial parameters correlate better to age and have three different growth phases.

Principal Component Analysis and Correlogram of dataset (200 patients x 30 variables) and Polynomial Regression for the glottic and cricoid diameters
